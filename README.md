# Simple Calculator
A basic Python script that takes two numbers and an arithmetic operation (+, -, *, /, %) as input and performs the calculation.

# Usage

1. Clone the repository:
`git clone https://github.com/swapneelsinghthakuri/calculator.git`

2. Navigate to the project directory:
`cd calculator`
3. Run the script:
`python calculator.py`
4. Enter the required inputs as prompted.
## How it works
The script prompts the user to enter two numbers and an arithmetic operation. It then performs the calculation based on the provided operation and displays the result.

## Supported Operations

- Addition (+)
- Subtraction (-)
- Multiplication (*)
- Division (/)
- Modulus (%)

## Example
```
Enter your number: 10
Enter sign (+, -, *, /, %): *
Enter last number: 5

Result: 50

```
## Note

- Make sure to input valid numbers and a supported arithmetic operation to get accurate results.
- If an invalid operation is entered, the script will display "Invalid output."
